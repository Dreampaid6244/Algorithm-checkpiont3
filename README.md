Defintion of algorithm


An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions designed to perform a task or solve a specific problem.
An algorithm is the logic or procedure behind solving a problem using code. It tells the computer how to do something




Key Features of an Algorithm:


Input: It takes zero or more inputs.

Output: It produces at least one output.

Definiteness: Each step is clearly defined.

Finiteness: It must finish after a finite number of steps.

Effectiveness: All steps are basic enough to be carried out

 
 
 Common Algorithm Types:'

 
Sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort)

Searching (e.g., Binary Search)

Recursion

Dynamic Programming

Greedy Algorithms

Backtracking



 Example (Simple Algorithm):

 
Problem: Find the largest number in an array.

Algorithm Steps:

Start with the first number as the maximum.

Compare it with the next number.

If the next number is greater, make it the new maximum.

Repeat until the end of the array.

Return the maximum
